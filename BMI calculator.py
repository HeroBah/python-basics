Tracking your BMI is a useful way of checking if you’re maintaining a healthy weight. It’s calculated using a person's weight and height, using this formula: weight / height²

The resulting number indicates one of the following categories:
Underweight = less than 18.5
Normal = more or equal to 18.5 and less than 25
Overweight = more or equal to 25 and less than 30
Obesity = 30 or more

Let’s make finding out your BMI quicker and easier, by creating a program that takes a person's weight and height as input and outputs the corresponding BMI category.
Weight is in kg, height is in meters.
Note, that height is a float.
Sample Input
85
1.9'''

weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))

bmi = weight / height**2

if bmi < 18.5:
    category = "Underweight"
elif 18.5 <= bmi < 25:
    category = "Normal"
elif 25 <= bmi < 30:
    category = "Overweight"
else:
    category = "Obesity"

print("Your BMI category is:", category)
